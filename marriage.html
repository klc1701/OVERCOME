				<p class="intro">The right to marry was not available to every citizen of the United States for a long time, neither was the equal protection under the law from a spouse. The movement for marriage rights encompasses more issues than simply the right to marry.</p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">THE RIGHT TO MARRY</h2>
			
			<p class="content">For a long time in the United States, not everyone had the freedom to marry whomever they wanted. Interracial marriage was illegal (a holdover from slavery and Jim Crow laws) up until 1967, when the Supreme Court ruled that anti-miscegenation laws were unconstitutional in the <i>Loving v. Virginia</i> decision. The ban on marriage between same-sex couples lasted even longer, decades past the Loving case. Legalization of same-sex marriage at the state-level did not begin until 2012; although it was legal for same-sex couples to marry in more than half the states by 2014, gay marriage was not legalized until 2015 in the landmark decision in <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i>. Still, there exists opposition to the ruling at state-levels.</p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE</h2>
			
			<p class="content">Divorce laws vary by state but generally involves issues of alimony, child support, and distribution of debt. In most cases, women have had the disadvantage of bearing the brunt of the social and economic burdens that comes with divorces. In colonial times, women were not recognized as having nay legal standing so they would have the most difficult time in receiving ownership of property or financial assets. In the early twentieth century, women began to gain more independence and had the financial standing to seek out divorces from abusive spouses, though they were still seen as the cause of the divorce, not the husband. </p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTION</h2>
			
			<p class="content">In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act, which established the Office on Violence Against Women  and provided funds to investigate violent crimes against women. Its renewal in 2013, when President Obama signed the bill into a law, improved services for marginalized groups: Native American women could now seek justice against non-Native offenders in Tribunal courts, LGBT victims of violence could no longer be discriminated against and can now have access to the same services as other survivors, immigrants were not given certain protections, and college students now enjoy more protection mandated by the law.</p>
