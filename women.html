				<p class="intro">Women have no doubt made impressive progress in improving our way of life but there is still so much to be done. Though we no longer remain in the shadows, we still need to make some noise to be heard.</p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">RIGHT TO EDUCATION</h2>
			
			<p class="content">Women first see change in the right to education in the 1800s, when there was a rapid development of secondary schooling. Academies for women begin to be established and a movement soon arose to achieve the same level of education as men. Schools for African American children, run by white women, began operating in the 1800s. After the Civil War, the number schools for black children rapidly increased. Native Americans were schooled in a similar way; because of the confinement of reservations, the skills Native American women were taught by their elders were no longer useful, and the missionaries stationed there became their source of education, making them more dependent on the American government.</p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">EQUAL EMPLOYMENT</h2>
			
			<p class="content">There are numerous acts that makes gender-based discrimination in the workplace illegal. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it became illegal to discriminate based on sex, and the Equal Pay Act states that women cannot be paid less on the basis of sex. However, inequality still persists. The gender wage gap has not improved, showing that women still make 79 cents to every dollar a man makes. The gap widens when women of color are taken into account, as well. Even with the same credentials, women tend to get paid less than an equally quliafied male counterpart; women with children especially suscpetible to this bias, while the jobs women often undertake are looked down upon.</p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">SEXUAL VIOLENCE</h2>
			
			<p class="content">Although the UN has acknowedged the issue of violence against women, it remains a prevalent problem. Women fall victim to sexual violence by intimate and non-intimate partners alike and are greater risk at getting pregnant and having abortions. Women's vulnerability to becoming victims to violence of any kind increases depending on sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability status, etc. There are several laws on violence against women, including the Violence Against Women Act and the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, which works through a hotline, giving grants, and supporting local programs that teach prevention.</p>
