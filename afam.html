			<h2 class="subheadline">ABOLITION OF SLAVERY</h2>
			
			<p class="content">Even though Britain had stopped her hand in the slave trade, the practice continued internally in the colonies. By the time the Civil War broke out, anti-slavery sentiment became a pretty popular idea, especially amongst white middle-aged women. A large part in gaining support for abolition was making the horrors of slavery known to the masses to gather sympathy; black and white abolistionists worked together to achieve their goal, as Olaudah Equiano did with the formation of an anti-slavery group, "The Sons of Africa." Freed and enslaved individuals campaigned passionately against slavery and came to fruition with the ratification Thirteenth Amendment. </p>

The decision, though made unanimously, was met with great resistance in the white public and resulted in violent interactions. The desegregation of public schools proved to be a ginat step for the Civil Rights Movement, which only grew from that point.
