			<h2 class="subheadline">AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE</h2>
			
			<p class="content">Racial and ethnic minorities are at an a disdvantage in acquiring access to affordable healthcare because of lack of health insurance and financial resources. Generally, these groups do not receive the same qulaity of service afforded to white individuals, especially immigrants, who face legal issues in obtaining the needed medication and appointments. Women also tend to face more financial obstacles in getting quality healthcare than men, proving to have more out-of-pocket expenses that are at least 10% more than her family income. </p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES</h2>
			
			<p class="content">The United States' mental health system is particularily lacking. A large reason for this is the lack of coordination between the entities that provide the services or resources that could help a patient should they work together. Funding for these services has also been declining. Thankfully, bills for mental health reform has just been recently introduced to both the House and the Senate that both aim to improve mental illness and care and the coordination between the programs that are able to provide the serives to do so. </p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS</h2>
			
			<p class="content">Reproductive rights have been a forefront in the feminist movement ever since the second wave feminism that took place in the 1960s. Due to gender-based discrimnation, poor financial standing, and violence against women, many women are able to get access to the care that they need. Supporters of women's reproductive rights have advocated&mdash; and continue to advocate&mdash;for safe and affordable contraception and abortion. In 2012, the federal government required all private health insurance providers to cover the cost of contraptives. The opposition to abortion, like against contraceptives, remains strong, despite the landmark <i>Roe v. Wade</i> case.</p>
