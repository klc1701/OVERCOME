			<h2 class="subheadline">VISIBILITY</h2>
			
			<p class="content">Even before the Stonewall Riots, considered the beginning of the LGBT rights movement, gay and lesbian individuals begin to emerge as a community. Following immediately after the riots is the first gay pride parade, marking when the movement begins to pick up speed. Following the assassination of openly gay politician Harvey Milk, the National March on Washington for Gay and Lesbian Rights takes place. The bisexual community has also since then grown, though the visibilty is not at the same level; the transgender community is the same, and as a result, activists have organized visibility holidays for both communities.</p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">HEALTHCARE FOR PWAs</h2>
			
			<p class="content">Activists have been advocating for better healthcare for PWAs, or people with AIDS. The epidemic first came to attention in the 1980s in young gay men and since then, organizations like ACT UP have formed to held impact the lives of PWAs by bringing about legislation, medical research, and treatment. There are legislation in place to help people living with AIDS, the largest being the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Legislation, which focuses on providing treatment to those who live with HIV and unisured or underinsured.

			<h2 class="subheadline">DISCRIMINATION AGAINST TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS</h2>
			
			<p class="content">More and more transgender people have been sharing their stories and experiences, helping to make the public more aware and understanding of gender identity. However, stigma still exists against transgender individuals. Transgender people face serious violence in the United States, especially transgender women of color, who also face sexism and racism. Debate over gender inclusive bathrooms have also been in the center of media attention. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice have decided that denying transgender people the right to use the bathroom they are most comfortable with is a form of discrimination, which is illegal under the Civil Rights Act. </p>
