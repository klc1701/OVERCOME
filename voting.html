				<h1 class="headline1">THE VOTE, THE VOICE</h1>
				<p class="intro">For the United States, a country founded on the principles of democracy, to deny people's rights to vote for as long as they did is deplorable. While black Americans were the most vocal, and indeed the most memorable, in the fight for the vote, other minority groups in America continued to suffer from being voiceless. </p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">THE RIGHT TO VOTE</h2>
			
			<p class="content">Of the minority groups in America in the twentieth century, white women were the first to gain the right to vote with the Nineteenth Amendment of 1920. Non-white citizens, however, had to wait longer to be given this right. Despite having abolished slavery nearly a century ago, the United States continued to treat its black inhabitants unfairly. It was not until the Fifteenth Amendment was passed were African Americans allowed to vote. Barriers to voting still existed at state and local levels until the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which also protected the right to vote for other minorities, like Native Americans and Asian Americans, who were made voting citizens before 1965 but still faced difficulties in actually voting.</p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">ACCESS TO BALLOT</h2>
			
			<p class="content">The Voting Rights Act of 1965 that targeted the practices that made it difficult to exercise the right to vote. The Act outlaws literacy tests, which were adminstered to African Americans with the specific purpose of keeping them from voting. Along with the harrassment and violence black Americans had to endure when they tried to register or to vote discouraged many from participating in voting. White American women, despite winning the right to vote almost four decades ago, did not fully exercise the right until the 1980s, though the presence of women in the government steadily increased since the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment.</p>

			<h2 class="subheadline">POLITICAL REPRESENTATION</h2>
			
			<p class="content">As a result of gaining the right to vote, women, African Americans, and other minority groups became more involved in politics. As of 2016, there are 104 women in Congress, 84 in the House, and three in the Supreme Court. Women of color hold a few seats in office, with eighteen black women in the House and one Asian Pacific-Islander in the Senate. Since the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a few Native Americans have also held office, with two serving in the executive branch.</p>

Patsy introduced two laws into Congress, the Early Childhood Education Act and Women's Educational Equity Act, both considered radical laws that advanced civil rights. In 2002, President George W. Bush renamed the IX Amendment of Higher Education Act after her.</p>
